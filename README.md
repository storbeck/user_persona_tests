| File/Folder                 | Purpose                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CLAUDE.md`                 | Core system instructions for the autonomous UX evaluator (load as your **system prompt**). |
| `personas/`                 | User profiles and missions that define how the agent behaves and what it tries to achieve. |
| ‚îú `cautious-newcomer.md`  | A tentative first-time visitor who values clarity and reassurance.                         |
| ‚îú `mobile-multitasker.md` | A busy user switching between apps on a small screen.                                      |
| ‚îú `visual-browser.md`     | A visually-driven user who navigates via imagery rather than text.                         |
| ‚îî `efficient-shopper.md`  | A pragmatic user optimizing for speed and simplicity.                                      |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin:

1. **An MCP-compatible client** that supports Playwright, such as:

   * Claude Desktop with a Playwright MCP server
   * Any MCP runner connected to Playwright
2. **Install the Playwright MCP server:**

   ```bash
   claude mcp add playwright npx '@playwright/mcp@latest'
   ```
3. **Ensure Chromium** (or your chosen browser) is installed and available to Playwright.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Enable Playwright MCP** in your AI client.

   ```bash
   claude mcp add playwright npx '@playwright/mcp@latest'
   ```
2. **Load `CLAUDE.md`** as your system instruction file.
3. **Choose a persona** from the `personas/` folder and paste its contents as the user prompt.
4. **Run the session.** The agent will:

   * Launch Chromium with tracing and video (if supported)
   * Emulate the persona‚Äôs mindset and behavior
   * Capture screenshots during key interactions
   * Generate a structured `report.md` with observations and recommendations

üí° **Tip:** If your MCP client supports per-session working directories, set it to this repository root so all reports and artifacts are saved here.

## üß† How Sessions Work

### System Layer (`CLAUDE.md`)

Defines the high-level testing flow:

* Initialize environment ‚Üí adopt persona ‚Üí perform tasks ‚Üí summarize results
* Enumerates allowed Playwright commands
* Specifies output formats (Markdown report, screenshot paths, etc.)

### Persona Layer (`personas/*.md`)

Describes *who* the user is and *how* they behave:

* **Target site** (e.g., `https://www.automationexercise.com/`)
* **Mindset & behavior profile** (e.g., ‚Äúbrowses by category, avoids search‚Äù)
* **Mission** (goal and success criteria)

### Output Layer

Each run produces:

* `report.md` ‚Äî Summary of steps, pain points, strengths, and recommendations
* Screenshots & traces ‚Äî Saved in `.playwright-mcp/` by default

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Adding or Editing Personas

1. Copy an existing file from `personas/` and update:

   * **Name & mindset** (e.g., ‚ÄúDetail-oriented researcher‚Äù)
   * **Target website**
   * **Mission & success criteria**
   * **Behavior profile** (e.g., ‚Äúscrolls thoroughly, ignores ads‚Äù)
2. Keep instructions **concise and literal** ‚Äî the agent follows them exactly.
3. Optionally define **viewport or device** (e.g., *iPhone 13 ‚Äî 375√ó812*) for mobile simulations.

## üß© Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Add Playwright MCP
claude mcp add playwright npx '@playwright/mcp@latest'

# 2. Start a session
# Load CLAUDE.md as system prompt
# Load personas/visual-browser.md as user prompt

# 3. Observe results
#   - report.md (UX findings)
#   - .playwright-mcp/screenshots/
#   - .playwright-mcp/traces/
```
